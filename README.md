## Ideas

* [ ] Add a "scroll to top" button.
* [ ] Add a way to share and load a collection by concatenating owned and needed ids in the url.
* [x] Add a shuffle button to get random results.
* [ ] Add a "yuk" button and filter.
* [x] Add a way to share a search's state (e.g to display only star wards products). This means we need to pass the query into the url.
